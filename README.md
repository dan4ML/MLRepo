Summary:
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
Two important principles of Github:

1). Version Control - Helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. An easy why to multiple developers to work on the same project with stepping all over each other codes and preserving the "offical" code during development is to use something called Branching. With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.

2). GIT - Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.
