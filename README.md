README: T5-3B LLM Chatbot for SQL Query Generation

Overview

This chatbot leverages a T5-3B Large Language Model (LLM) to translate natural language user queries into SQL statements. It then retrieves relevant data from a connected database and returns the results to the user in an accessible format. The system facilitates intuitive interaction with a database without requiring users to know SQL.

Features

Natural Language Input: Users can express their data needs in plain language.

Automated SQL Generation: The chatbot uses the T5-3B model to convert user input into SQL queries.

Database Connectivity: Generated SQL is executed against the connected database.

Result Summarization: Query results are formatted and returned to the user for easy reading.

Prerequisites

Software Requirements (For Administrators Only):

Python (version 3.8 or higher)

PyTorch (for running the T5-3B model)

Transformers library (from Hugging Face)

Database Connector: Install the required Python library for your database (e.g., cx_Oracle for Oracle, psycopg2 for PostgreSQL).

Flask (for hosting the chatbot interface).

Hardware Requirements (For Administrators Only):

CPU (mandatory; no GPU required for this setup).

Adequate memory to handle the T5-3B model.

Additional Resources (For Administrators Only):

Access to the target database, including connection details (host, port, user credentials).

Setup and Training

Step 1: Download Pretrained Model and Dataset

Pretrained Model: Download the pretrained T5-3B model from Hugging Face:

from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-3b")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-3b")

Spider Dataset: Download the Spider dataset from Hugging Face or other sources.

# Example using datasets library
from datasets import load_dataset

spider_dataset = load_dataset("spider")

Step 2: Fine-tune the Model

Fine-tune the T5-3B model using the Spider dataset to specialize it for text-to-SQL translation.

# Pseudocode for fine-tuning
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=spider_dataset['train'],
    eval_dataset=spider_dataset['validation'],
)

trainer.train()

Step 3: Save the Fine-Tuned Model

Save the fine-tuned model for later use in the chatbot application.

model.save_pretrained("./t5-3b-finetuned")

User Guide

Accessing the Chatbot

Open a web browser on any device connected to the network or internet.

Navigate to the chatbot's URL, provided by your administrator (e.g., http://chatbot.example.com).

Interacting with the Chatbot

Enter a query in natural language, such as:

"Show me the total sales for the last quarter."

The chatbot will:

Parse the input.

Convert it into an SQL query using the fine-tuned T5-3B model.

Execute the query against the database.

Return the results in an easy-to-read format.

Viewing Results

The query results will appear directly on the chatbot interface. For example:

how many employees are there?
T5-3B-finetuned128: 30:
[4.42 secs]

Architecture (For Administrators Only)

Input Processing:

User input is preprocessed to remove noise and ambiguities.

SQL Query Generation:

The T5-3B model fine-tuned for text-to-SQL tasks generates SQL based on the input.

Query Execution:

The SQL is passed to a database handler that connects to the database and executes the query.

Response Formatting:

The database results are summarized and formatted for the user.

Troubleshooting (For Administrators Only)

Chatbot Not Accessible:

Ensure the Flask server is running.

Verify the URL provided to users.

Database Connection Errors:

Verify the database credentials and network access.

Ensure the appropriate Python database connector is installed.

Unexpected SQL or Results:

Validate the natural language input for clarity.

Review the generated SQL for accuracy.
